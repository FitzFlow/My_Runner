First, you need to compile the game. To do it, you need to "make", with the command "make" for compile the game, or "make re" to recompile the game.

Like this:
            ```make``` or like this : ```make re```

After that, you will have an executable named "my_runner" and you must execute him with a map located in the map folder. By default, there are 1 map that i created, and one file named "custom map", so like that you can create your custom map (place a "1" for create an obstacle).

For launch the game:
            ```./my_runner map/the_map_you_want_to_load```

Now enjoy !

PS: I developed my game in fedora with CSFML and other lib, so I can't be sure it will compile or run in Windows.
    After you can try to install all the packages needed.

PS2: If you are an EPITECH Student, don't stole my code
